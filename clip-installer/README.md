# Brief

This is a prototype for a program that fetches all xbox game captures and saves them as an mp4 onto my local device. Currently it only fetches the first 100 captures and it only saves the first clip. This is to be replaced by a C++ program for faster speeds. This program might be written fully and its speed will be compared to the C++ version to see which is faster.
