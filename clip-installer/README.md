This is a prototype for a program that fetches all xbox game captures and saves them as an mp4 onto my local device. Currently it only fetches the first 100 captures and it only saves the first clip. The problem is that the GET request takes up around 6 seconds fore every URI request. I am exploring implementations that cut down on execution times. Considering multithreading.
