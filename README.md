# Xbox Captures App

When Xbox announced they would no longer be storing Xbox captures for more than 90 days, I was dismayed. They offered a method of uploading clips to OneDrive but this method was tedious and I hate OneDrive, so I decided to make this. 

This is a web application meant to display the Xbox captures from my account. This is being built using React with TypeScript. My plan is to create a backend that will fetch new clips over an undecided interval and store them to a SQL database. This is a web application meant to display the Xbox captures from my account. This is being built using React with TypeScript.

This will be updated as the project progresses.

## Installation

To install and locally run the frontend:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.

3) Ensure you have Node.js installed. If you do not, vist [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2) Check into the /frontend subdirectory and run `npm install` This will ensure you have the required dependencies.

3) Run `npm start` to compile and start the development build.

You now have the app up and running!

## Notes

- Full project architecture will be created soon.

- As of now, all development is being done locally (ie. database, backend, development build are all local).
